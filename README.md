Opinionated notes and scripts for setting up a fresh Pop!\_OS computer for web development, gaming, and general hobbying _(Follow at your own risk / benefit)_

## Usage

1. Download this repo, unzip and `cd` into it. 
2. Check and modify `packages/apt.txt`, `packages/brew.txt` and `packages/flatpak.txt` as you desire. Each line consists of a command and its package names (if package name differs from command) - separated by a `;` character. 
Note, Multiple package names are separated again, by a `,` character.
3. Run `sudo bash ./setup.sh` and answer the `y/n` prompts as they appear. 

## Packages 

TODO: Need to update these lists as they're now out of date.

### Homebrew

Brew (macOS package manager) can be useful for installing non-cask packages.

- `spaceship`
- `zsh-autosuggestions`
- `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- `fastfetch`
- `speedtest-cli`

### Clean-up

Due to Flatpak sandbox issues, and other listed issues, I recommend installing the following apps without a package manager.

- `Steam` - Game client/store. Advise installing straight from the `.deb` on the [Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/about/download). Especially if you want to use controllers.
- `DBeaver` - Database management. Advise installing straight from the `.deb` on the [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/files/dbeaver-ce_latest_amd64.deb) due to dbeaver/dbeaver#20371.
- `Lutris` - Multi-system game organiser. Advise installing straight from the `.deb` on the [Lutris releases page](https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases) due to sandboxing issues.

## VS Code Extensions

- I've included Github Copilot as a `.visx` file, since you can't install GHCP the regular way with Codium.
- Shout-out to @ustas-eth for the [https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1487](\[GUIDE\] to running Copilot in VSCodium)
- https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1487#discussioncomment-5833624
- Other extensions relate to me and my work, so ignore if not needed.
