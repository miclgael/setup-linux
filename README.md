# ðŸ§‹ Setup Linux

Opinionated notes and scripts for setting up a fresh Pop!\_OS computer for web development, gaming, and general hobbying _(Follow at your own risk / benefit)_

> ðŸ’¡ I also have guides for [macOS](https://github.com/miclgael/setup) and [Windows](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win)!

**NB: Tested on POP_OS 22.04 (Jammy)**

## Usage

1. Download this repo, unzip and `cd` into it. 
2. Check and modify `packages/apt.txt`, `packages/brew.txt` and `packages/flatpak.txt` as you desire. Each line consists of a command and its package names (if package name differs from command) - separated by a `;` character. 
Note, Multiple package names are separated again, by a `,` character.
3. Run `sudo bash ./setup.sh` and answer the `y/n` prompts as they appear.

## Code Extensions

- I've included Github Copilot as a `.visx` file, since you can't install GHCP the regular way with Codium.
- Shout-out to @ustas-eth for the [https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1487](\[GUIDE\] to running Copilot in VSCodium)

- Other extensions relate to me and my work, so ignore if not needed.
